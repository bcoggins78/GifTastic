# GifTastic TV


### UNC Coding BootCamp Week 6 Homework Project


**[https://bcoggins78.github.io/GifTastic/](https://bcoggins78.github.io/GifTastic/)**.

This project introduces the use of the JQuery API Ajax.  Ajax is used with the Giphy API at https://api.giphy.com to query and get specific search items.  A tv show theme is used so each query gets information for the specific tv show.  This is accomplished by clicking a tv show button at the top of the page and then 10 gif images are displayed that is related to that show.  To animate the image simply click on it. Animation can be stopped by clicking it again. A new show button can be added by using the form below the buttons.

This project was built with:

* HTML 
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
